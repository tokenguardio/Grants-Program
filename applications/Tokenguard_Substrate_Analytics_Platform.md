## Project Overview ðŸ“„

  

This application is in response to the RFP [https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/RFPs/Under Development/analysis-website-and-data-platform](https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/RFPs/Under%20Development/analysis-website-and-data-platform).

  

### Overview

  

The existing challenge in the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystems is **the absence of a user-friendly on-chain analytics platform**. Currently, querying data through GraphQL and backend services like Subquery and Subsquid requires considerable effort. Creating compelling and visually attractive dashboards is almost impossible due to lack of tools that focus on end user experinece. As a result, power-users and builders face difficulties in interactively accessing high-quality data and creating custom visualizations for easy sharing.

  

  

To address this challenge, we propose an easy-to-use and efficient solution - an advanced data analytics tool designed to cater specifically to the needs of the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystems and related parachains. Our platform offers seamless data querying, simplifying the creation of customized charts and visualizations, **facilitating easy sharing of valuable insights and metrics within the**  **community.**

  

  

With the aim of ensuring extensive accessibility across the Substrate community and optimizing the functionality of our analytical tool, Tokenguard application places **a strong emphasis on refining the UX aspect**. This involves the development of an intuitive user interface (UI) and seamless frontend that effectively facilitates insights discovery.

  

  

### Project Details

  

To meet the expectations of Polkadot and Kusama community and the suggestions contained in the RFP, we propose a **comprehensive analytics tool consisting of**  **a query builder, visualization creator and dashboard composer for Polkadot & Kusama ecosystems** - the creation of which requires the implementation of the following areas:

  

  

1. Data model:
	- Creating a RAW data access that would categorize data depending on its depth:
		1. L0: Relay chains (Polkadot, Kusama)
		2. L1: Parachains
		3. L2: dApps & Smart Contracts
	- Creating a database of pre-transformed, comparable & curated metrics - each of the metric would be a pre-defined SQL query based on RAW data that is curated by Tokenguard team:
		1. User related metrics
		2. Activity related metrics
		3. Conversions related metrics
2. Metrics 
	- Creation:
		1. Allowing users to create their own SQL queries from scratch and save them.
		2. Allowing users to preview SQL query of each of the existing metrics at Tokenguard.
		3. Allowing users to copy, edit and save each of the existing metrics.
	- Collection:
		1. List of projects on different depths (L0, L1, L2)
		2. List of RAW tables available for these projects
		3. List of comparable metrics for these projects

4. Dashboards
	- Making it possible for people to create & share dashboards with their own metrics as well as Tokenguard curated metrics:
		1. Allowing for choosing how to display a metric (more than 10 types of visualizations available)
		2. Allowing for commenting dashboards
		3. Adding tags to dashboards
	- Creating a search engine for dashboards
5. Users
	- Creating a user subpage with a list of users' dashboards & metrics

  

  

### **Beta Version - existing Tokenguard features**

  

(You can access public version of Tokenguard app at [app.tokenguard.io](http://app.tokenguard.io/))

  

  

Over the course of six months, Tokenguard application was meticulously developed with the objective of creating a user-friendly analytics tool for the Substrate Ecosystem, without requiring any coding or SQL skills. Within this timeframe, we successfully produced a beta version of the app, which now offers essential on-chain analytics for various projects within the Polkadot ecosystem, such as Astar & Aleph Zero - our lovely customers.

**Technology Stack:**

* JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
* SQL, dbt, Airflow
* Kubernetes
* SubSquid
* BI analytics tools
* Cloud hosting and scalable infrastructure

### Maintenance

In order to maintain an on-chain analytical tool covering the entire ecosystem, it is necessary to index, store, maintain and process data from relay chains and nearly a hundred parachains with different pallets, the number of which is constantly growing.


We are in the process of working out the most optimal solution with the Parity team to cover the maintenance costs with the [Polkadot Data Alliance Parent Bounty (WIP)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fA5ARHy-frzgZC66rniKZ5o7CSbDvCTkS--kWaMzuMs/edit#), taking into consideration the following solutions:

* Indexing and storing the data in-house - which offers a high quality experience for the end-user due to possibility of pre-aggregating the data and working out the ETL process so that the data is displayed almost real-time.

* Using SubSquid archives - dependent on the SubSquid business model regarding its data distribution model in the future and possibility of accessing RAW data rather than GraphQL endpoint.

* Using substrate-etl - dependent on the quality and availability of the data. Currently the data has a significant delay, potentially decreasing the usability of the data. Additionally, due to the size of relay chains history, querying the data through BigQuery is extremely expensive.

The best model is yet to be decided with Polkadot Data Alliance and will be a matter of discussion after the PoC is designed and costs of each solution is known.

  
### Other Proposals Comparison

  

[RFP](https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/RFPs/Under%20Development/analysis-website-and-data-platform) has been partially addressed by other teams in the proposals [#1716](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1716) [#1768](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1768) [#1748](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1748) [#1815](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1815) and work is underway to solve it. Being aware of how wide and complex the area of data analysis is, in our solution, we wanted to refer to the issues and propose modules that have not yet been built, but will complement the ongoing work.

Compared to the following, Tokenguard in this proposal provides both a user-friendly no-code query editor and SQL query editor; visualization creator and dashboard composer - which UX / UI is designed in an accessible way, reaching a wide audience; sharing feature that allows for efficient sharing of created metrics and better data analysis.

While:
* [#1716](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1716) - is an ETL tool that focuses on delivering the Polkadot ecosystem data to a wide audience using Google BigQuery service.

* [#1768](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1768) - is an ETL tool focused on deep account analytics challenges.

* [#1748](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1748) - is a data analytics tool that focuses on wallet profiling and tracking its investments and structure.

* [#1815](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1815) - is a low-level SQL query editor and vizualization creator dedicated for data engineers and data scientists.


### Ecosystem Fit

In order to facilitate growth, Substrate ecosystem needs a vast and thriving environment of developers creating parachains, dApps and smart contracts. Each parachain and each smart contract generates thousands of transactions that store important technical and business insights. Each new growing dApp, with its own marketing & growth strategy, **brings in new active users to the ecosystem and venture capital money**. These insights are currently hard to discover and the ecosystem needs infrastructure tools that would make it easy for management teams and developers to uncover them, similarly as it is done in EVM environment with tools like Dune Analytics or Tenderly.

Tokenguard addresses the need of following audiences:


**Community:**
* Transparency & Credibility:
	* Access to data and on-chain insights is the basis for a community driven blockchain.
	* The ability to track and verify activity and growth in the parachains reinforces trust.
* Investment:
	* A tool that gives access to the performance of individual dApps and DeFi allows for a better assessment of the market situation in terms of investment.
	* Insights into data on developer activity and TVL allows to attract additional community members who want to invest in the ecosystem.
* Engagement:
	* A well-informed community is more likely to be involved in the building programs on a given chain and in ongoing activities.
	* Access to insights allows the community to actively promote chain in social media, at events and in ordinary media.

**Relay chains, parachains and dApps teams:**


* Marketing Improvements:
	* Off-chain to on-chain data correlation provides a deeper understanding of the marketing and PR efforts that contribute to the networkâ€™s growth
	* Developer engagement tracking allows to identify strategies that in fact encourage web3 creators to build within the ecosystem.
	* User segmentation and user behavior tracking allows to understand which protocols and dApps generate the most traffic for the network and what type of user affects its growth.
* More efficient Treasury Spending:
	* Tracking the KPIs and inflow of new users through dApps and on-chain projects financed through relay chains and parachains treasury grants.
	* Source of reliable data to support discussion and decisions during treasury votings.
* Strengthening Operations & Security:
	* Real-time monitoring and alerts enable the team to respond more effectively in the face of potential threats such as rug pulls.
	* Thanks to access to on-chain insights, such as a TVL in DeFi or a Smart Contract creation per developer, Tokenguard helps understand how to better optimize the operations of parachains for individual entities.

## Development Roadmap ðŸ”©

Having a lot of experience in building web3 products, our team is aware that there are many challenges behind building a fully functional analytics platform similar to Dune for an ecosystem as vast and diverse as Polkadot & Kusama. We acknowledge the fact that a lot of questions need to be answered and W3F requirements need to be specified to fully estimate the cost of creating such a solution that will be **easily upgradable and basically - fun for users**. We therefore propose to split the work on the project into 2 grants / proposals:
* PoC and maintenance cost estimation
* Fully functional platform

This proposal is the first part that is solely focused on preparation of the PoC, defining the requirements of the final solution and estimating its production and maintenance costs. As an effect, we will be able to prepare a well thought out second proposal that will include all the expected features and cover all costs to deliver a user-engaging product.

## Future Plans
### Analytics for Polkadot & Kusama ecosystems
The module implemented under this proposal lays the foundation for covering the entire Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem with accessible and user-friendly tool for on-chain insights and analysis. PoC of query builder, visualization creator, dashboard composer for Polkadot and Kusama Relay Chains enables further scaling of the analytical tool to the entire ecosystem.

The next steps will consist of a proposal to create a common dataset of metrics for each category of pallets/parachains; creating a more complex query builder, automated/semi-automated process of new parachain inclusion; automated/semi-automated process of user-requested tables aggregation; indexing and maintaining a database for the entire ecosystem (in cooperation with the Parity team).

### Making web3 grow
At the same time, continuing the current activities, Tokenguard will offer its services to provide private dashboards with advanced features to subsequent parachains in order to improve their marketing and operational activities.

With backing up of well-known web3 investors, Tokenguard is on its path to help web3 ecosystems and dApps understand their user behavior and focus on marketing & product strategies that deliver organic growth.
